# Gradient Orthogonalization 

A simple demo to orthogonalize a random matrix using gradient descent. Comparing to Schmidt orthogonalization, a random orthogonal matrix generated by this method does not contain extremely high or low value in the matrix, so after standardization, such matrix would be brighter. Therefore, in ghost imaging experiments, the detector can receive more signal and return a better image.
